JLIB_RULES_SETTING_NOTES="1. If you change the setting, it will apply to this and all child groups, components and content. Note that:<br /> <em>Inherited</em> means that the permissions from the parent group will be used.<br /> <em>Denied</em> means that no matter what the parent group's setting is, the group being edited cannot take this action.<br /> <em>Allowed</em> means that the group being edited will be able to take this action (but if this is in conflict with the parent group it will have no impact; a conflict will be indicated by <em>Not Allowed (Locked)</em> under Calculated Settings).<br /> <em>Not Set</em> is used only for the Public group in global configuration. The Public group is the parent of all other groups. If a permission is not set, it is treated as deny but can be changed for child groups, components, categories and items.<br />2. If you select a new setting, click <em>Save</em> to refresh the calculated settings."
